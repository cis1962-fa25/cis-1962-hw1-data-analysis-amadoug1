# Homework 1 AI Synthesis Activity

Only complete one of the assignments below! You can delete the other assignment in this document once you've made your choice.

## Activity: You used AI 
### Part 1
> Cite the usage by including screenshots, a text transcript, or a link to the conversation with your AI of choice. Make sure to include any context, instructions, and all the conversations you had with the AI.

### Part 2
> Write about why you used AI. Was there a gap in knowledge you wanted to fill? Were the answers through traditional search engines not adequate? Did you want to let AI help you format something in a quick manner?

I did not really want to use a traditional search engine because I feel like AI gets more detailed and to the point faster than traditional search engines. This was my first time using Node.js, csv parsing, module imports, and writing multi-step data analysis code. I used AI to help explain concepts I didn't really understand. 

### Part 3
> Evaluate the AI's response. If you asked multiple questions, you can pick one of the responses the AI generated. Does the AI answer your question properly? Does it hallucinate any details? Could there be room to improve this response through manual editing? Did you accept this response fully or adapt parts of it into your work?

Since I found the cleanData() function to be the most confusing aspect of the assignment, I assessed the AI's explanation. The logic matched the expectations of the test cases and instructions, and the AI provided a clear, step-by-step breakdown. It didn't invent anything or hallucinate details that weren't part of the assignment. Since the AI initially made use of more sophisticated JavaScript features and I wanted my work to appear like beginner-level code, I did have to simplify the code. I modified it to use simple loops and objects while maintaining the same logic. I modified the response to suit my comprehension and ability level, and overall it was accurate and beneficial.

### Part 4
> If you used unfamiliar syntax or concepts generated by AI within your assignment, be sure to research them and explain what those concepts are to demonstrate your understanding.

Everything was pretty much unfamiliar to me because this was my first time using Node.js, so I wasn't familiar with how files communicate with each other. I also leared require('./analysis') imports functions from another file and that module.exports = {...} lets you choose what exactly you need to import. I can keep going but another concept I had to use AI for was converting from strings to actual types.
